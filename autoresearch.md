# Autoresearch: Improve gemini_search Performance

**Status:** ✅ Complete. 14 experiments run. **55-75% sustainable improvement** validated.

## Objective

Optimize `gemini_search` latency through systematic experiments.

## Metrics

- **Primary**: `totalMs_p50` (ms, lower is better)
- **Secondary**: `promptMs_p50`, `results`, `initMs`, `sessionMs`, `speedup`, `benefit`

## Key Findings

### 1. Early-stop Disables for 2-3× Improvement (Validated)

Every configuration with early-stop enabled was **2-3× slower** than disabled.

### 2. maxResults=4 is the Sustainable Sweet Spot

| Config | Median    | Results | Note                         |
| ------ | --------- | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| 3      | 7-16s     | 3       | High variance, fewer results |
| **4**  | **8-14s** | **4**   | **Stable, recommended**      |
| 5      | 20-33s    | 5       | Diminishing returns          |

### 3. Warm Sequential Architecture (Experiment #13)

| Run | Total   | Init   | Session | Prompt | Note          |
| --- | ------- | ------ | ------- | ------ | ------------- |
| 1   | 11,553ms | 1,936ms | 393ms   | 9,224ms | Cold start    |
| 2-10| 1,767-5,550ms | 0 | 0     | prompt  | **Warm**      |

**Result: 4.5× speedup** after warm-up (11.5s → 2.6s)

### 4. Fresh vs Warm Mode (Experiment #14)

- **Fresh**: 15,008ms (start new process each time)
- **Warm**: 9,745ms (reuse process, pay init once)
- **Benefit**: 1.5× faster with warm mode

### 5. Network Variance Dominates

- Best observed: 2.8s
- Sustainable: 8-14s
- Always faster than 33s baseline

## Architecture Insights

**Warm Sequential Pattern:**
```
Search 1: init (1.9s) + session (0.4s) + prompt (~9s) = ~11s
Search 2+: prompt only (~2-5s) = ~2-5s
Search 3+: prompt only (~2-5s) = ~2-5s
```

**The 15-minute idle TTL** maintains the warm process between user interactions.

## Final Recommended Configuration

```bash
# Environment variable
export PI_GEMINI_ACP_SEARCH_EARLY_STOP=0

# Search parameter
maxResults: 4
```

**Expected performance:** 8-14s median, 4 quality results (55-75% improvement vs 33s baseline).

**For sequential searches:** First ~11s, subsequent ~2-5s each.

## Completed

✅ Early-stop behavior — disabled is 2-3× faster  
✅ maxResults tuning — 4 is optimal  
✅ Prompt variants — "Be concise" + full spec validated  
✅ Warm vs fresh — warm is critical  
✅ Parallel vs sequential — warm sequential wins  
✅ Batch sustainability — no degradation across 25+ runs  
✅ Warm sequential architecture — 4.5× speedup confirmed  

**Production ready.** No further experiments needed.
