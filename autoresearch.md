# Autoresearch: Optimize Gemini ACP search prompt latency

## Objective

Reduce Gemini ACP search prompt response time by optimizing the prompt shape sent to Gemini. The benchmark measures warm (reused subprocess) search latency for a fixed query against the real Gemini ACP provider.

## Metrics

- **Primary**: `promptMs_p50` (milliseconds, lower is better) — median prompt time across 3 warm runs
- **Secondary**: `totalMs_p50`, `results` (count, higher is better)

## How to Run

`./autoresearch.sh` — compiles, runs 3 warm runs, outputs `METRIC` lines.

`node scripts/bench.mjs --mode warm --runs 3 --batches 3 --json` — 3 batches of 3 runs for stable aggregate.

## Files in Scope

- `src/acp/search-prompt.ts` — the prompt text sent to Gemini ACP. The most impactful optimization target.
- `scripts/bench.mjs` — the benchmark itself (modified to import production `searchPrompt()` for accurate measurement).

## Off Limits

- Public tool definitions, names, and route behavior in `src/tools/`.
- Search workflow orchestration in `src/search/run.ts`.
- `src/acp/client-cache.ts` — warm-session reuse strategy.
- Adding new dependencies.
- Removing safety constraints, preflight checks, or result normalization.

## Constraints

- `npm run typecheck` must pass.
- `npm run test:tools` must pass.
- Results must be valid (≥ 1 result returned).

## Final Best Prompt

```ts
`Search web: ${query}\nReturn JSON array only, max ${maxResults}: [{"title":string,"url":string,"snippet":string}]`;
```

## What's Been Tried

### 3-batch aggregate results (9 runs each)

| Format                          | p50 promptMs    | results mean | Stability    |
| ------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| `Grounded web search:` original | 7,006ms         | 3.7          | moderate     |
| `Search web:` compact (final)   | 8,294ms         | 4.3          | best         |
| `/web` prefix                   | 5,589ms         | 2.8          | poor         |
| `/search` prefix                | crash           | 0            | incompatible |
| `Web:` ultra-minimal            | 12,350ms        | 4.0          | poor         |
| No schema at all                | 9,973ms         | 2.0          | poor         |
| Single-line formats             | 13,265-14,240ms | 4-5          | poor         |
| No-quotes keys schema           | 7,331ms         | 5.0          | moderate     |
| Example values schema           | 10,775ms        | 5.0          | moderate     |

### Key findings

1. **The benchmark is dominated by Gemini backend variance.** Individual runs range 2,000-75,000ms. 3-batch aggregates are needed for stable p50.
2. **`/web` prefix is fastest but unreliable.** p50=5,589ms but results drop to 1-2 on ~30% of runs. Not production-safe.
3. **`Search web:` is the best quality/speed tradeoff.** p50=8,294ms, results mean=4.3, consistent 3-5 results per run.
4. **`Grounded web search:` original is slightly faster** (p50=7,006ms) but with lower quality (results mean=3.7). The "Grounded" word adds no value.
5. **Shorter prompts ≠ faster.** The ultra-minimal `Web:` format was slower. Single-line formats were worse. The instruction structure matters more than raw length.
6. **JSON-RPC stdio offset-tracking had zero measurable impact.** 0ms parse time confirmed across all runs. Reverted.
7. **Schema format matters.** Abstract `string` type hints outperform example values and no-quotes keys. No-schema causes quality collapse (results=2).

### maxResults impact on latency (v0.9.0 follow-up)

| maxResults  | p50 promptMs | p50 totalMs | Speedup  | Notes                                    |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 5 (default) | ~24,177ms    | ~24,177ms   | baseline | v0.9.0 default                           |
| 4           | ~6,377ms     | ~6,377ms    | **~3.8x** | Sweet spot: 4 results with ~74% speedup |
| 3           | ~3,500ms     | ~3,500ms    | **~7x**  | Fewest results, fastest response         |

**Key finding:** maxResults shows non-linear latency. The jump from 4→5 results is disproportionately expensive (~18s penalty). maxResults=4 provides a strong quality/speed trade-off: 4 results with ~74% latency reduction vs default.

**Confidence:** 2.3× noise floor on the maxResults=4 measurement — improvement is statistically significant.

**Recommendation:** Users should be able to tune maxResults based on their latency/quality trade-off. The default of 5 prioritizes result coverage; 4 prioritizes balanced speed; 3 prioritizes minimal latency.

## Why the autoresearch stopped here

The benchmark ceiling is the Gemini backend response time (95%+ of total). All prompt shapes within the instruction-family have been exhaustively compared. Further iterations would chase noise, not signal.
