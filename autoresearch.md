# Autoresearch: Improve gemini_search Performance

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**. 17 experiments run. **~88% improvement** achieved (median).

## Final Validation (Experiment #17)

**Configuration:** maxResults=4, early-stop=0, warm mode, specific query  
**Sample size:** 20 runs  
**Outcome:** Production-ready with realistic variance expectations

| Metric           | Value       | Interpretation              |
| ---------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| **p50 (median)** | **4,011ms** | ✅ **~88% vs 33s baseline** |
| mean             | 8,742ms     | Pulled up by outliers       |
| p95              | 37,068ms    | 5% of queries very slow     |
| min              | 2,759ms     | Best case                   |
| max              | 37,068ms    | Worst case                  |
| CV               | 101%        | High network variance       |

**Distribution:** Typical network service — 50% fast (~4s), 5% slow (~37s). Our optimizations improve the median, not the tail variance.

## Production Configuration

```bash
# Environment variable
export PI_GEMINI_ACP_SEARCH_EARLY_STOP=0

# Search parameter
maxResults: 4

# Query guidance
Specific, detailed queries outperform broad ones.
```

## Expected Performance

| Scenario          | Latency | Note                             |
| ----------------- | ------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Typical (p50)** | **~4s** | 50% of queries                   |
| Fast              | ~2.8s   | Best observed                    |
| Slow (p95)        | ~37s    | 5% tail — network/model variance |
| Cold start        | ~18s    | First search in new session      |
| Warm sequential   | ~2.7s   | Subsequent searches              |

## Architecture Summary

**Why Our Optimizations Work:**

1. **Early-stop disabled** — abort mechanism adds 2-3× overhead
2. **maxResults=4** — fewer results = less token generation
3. **Warm session** — amortizes 1.9s init + 0.4s session across searches
4. **Specific queries** — better search grounding with detailed terms

**Why Variance Remains:**

- Gemini backend response time dominates (95%+ of total)
- Network jitter
- Model/routing decisions
- Search result complexity

**Optimizations improve the median, not the tail.**
